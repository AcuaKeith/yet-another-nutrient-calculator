A web calculator for common and not-so-common fertilizers used by planted aquarium nerds. Extra cool is it opens a bunch of nested divs to draw a graph to compare the calculated value vs known and well regarded methods. Live site here: http://calc.petalphile.com

I'd like to make the logic a lot more readable and learn something along the way, and so I thin the next step is to pull out all the bits nutes.rb does into separate and more logical files.  I'd love guidance on how to do that and think of the bits of the script.


Compounds for input are in compound_constants.yml.
	You'll need percent mass, teaspoon concentrations, and target element/compound or else everything breaks.
PPM ranges for recommended methods are in graph_ppmconstants.yml.
	We use this to generate the graph and convert pixels to parts-per-million of the target element/compound.
